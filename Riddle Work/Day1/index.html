        DATATYPES:
            Numbers;
                Int           -> -2, -1, 0, 1, 2                                    (Whole numbers)
                float point   -> -2.1, -1.45, 0.11, 1.9921, 2.9171223               (Numbers with decimals)

            Strings;
                Single Quotes -> 'a', 'Hello World
                Double Quotes -> "b", "Hello World"
                Backticks     -> `c`, `Hello World`

            Booleans;
                True          -> if condition is met/something is turned on
                False         -> if condition isnt met/something is turned off

            Undefined;
                let firstName;

            Null;
                let emptyValue = null;                                              (Returns null meaing empty value)

            Comments;

                                    Meaning any lines inbetween the open and close indicators
                                    are comments

        VARIABLES:
            When creating variables, name conventions are very important. Here are some rules to follow;
                - Should NOT begin with a number
                - Should NOT have any special characters (Â£,&,-,+, etc.) EXEPT for underscores and dollar sign
                - Follow camelCase convention (letter of first word = lower case, every word after the first = first letter capital. See examples)
                - Should NOT have any spaces between words

            Examples of valid variable names;
                - firstName                                                         (camelCase)
                - lastName

                - first_name                                                        (Underscore as spaces)
                - last_name

                - num1                                                              (Numbers not the first character)
                - num_2

                - $num1                                                             (Accepts $ as a character )
                - $isMarried

            Examples of invalid variable names;
                - first-name                                                        (The dash symbol (-) is a special character that is NOT accepted)

                - 1_name                                                            (Can NOT have number as first character) 

                - has_#_children                                                    (The hashtag symbol (#) is a special character that is NOT accepted)
            
            How to declare a variable;
                let (variable name) = (value);                                      (let is a variable that can change during the programme)
                const (variable name) = (value);                                    (const means it does not change)

            Examples of valid variables;
                let age = 10;
                const gravity = 9.81;
                
                (You can also declare multiple lines variables in one line. Its recommended to do seperate line declarations to make code more readable)
                let name = "Riddle", job = "Unemployed", lives = "Ireland";
